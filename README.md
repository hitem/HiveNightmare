HiveNightmare for Bash Bunny

GossiTheDog made HiveNightmare.exe to streamline the process of extracting SAM SECURITY and SYSTEM. I simply made a BashBunny script to leverage this.
Make sure you visit his repository to get the *.exe

# Mitigation
And for all security reasearchers and workers out there, i also added the /Mitigation/ for Bash Bunny so you can easly start remedy your farm! :)
Note: Only tested on Windows 10. As for Servers, be VERY causious with the Mitigation script as it deletes shadowvolumes.
