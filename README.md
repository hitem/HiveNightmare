HiveNightmare for Bash Bunny

GossiTheDog made HiveNightmare.exe to streamline the process of extracting SAM SECURITY and SYSTEM. I could copy his code but what man am i? or birb? Anyways, I simply made a BashBunny script to leverage this.
Make sure you visit his repository to get the *.exe

# Mitigation
And for all security researchers and workers out there, i also added the /Mitigation/ so you can easily start remedy your farm! :). Note that this might require some extra steps for deployment. In my testing, on a Windows 10 with high privileges, it worked out the box.
IMPORTANT: Only tested on Windows 10. As for Servers, be VERY cautious with the Mitigation script as it deletes VSS, in some cases those are used for backup.
